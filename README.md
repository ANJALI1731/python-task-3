TASK 3 

This chatbot is created for my internship task using Python and NLTK. It's mainly for 12th pass students who want to ask about college details. The bot can answer questions like what courses are available, what is the eligibility, how to apply, what's the cutoff, fee structure, hostel facility, placements, location, and contact info. I made it using keyword matching, so even if someone just types “cutoff” or “fees”, it will understand and give the answer. It runs easily on mobile using the Pydroid 3 app. I just used basic NLTK (no machine learning), and it replies smartly based on the input. This is Task 3 of CODTECH Internship and I’ve written everything in a single Python file. Just run the script, and you can chat with it. It's simple and useful for anyone who wants to know about college.
